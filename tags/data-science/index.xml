      <description>The Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship by KPMG was my initial guide into the world of data analytics.
The entire experience was divided into three modules - Data Quality Assessment, Data Insights, and Presentation.
Data Quality Assessment dealed with the preparation and cleaning of data to get it ready for analysis. A dataset related to bicycle sales was provided.
Data Insights involved figuring out the high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.</description>

      <description>The Data Science &amp;amp; Machine Learning Internship provided by UNP (United Network of Professionals) was an excellent introduction to the foundational topics of data science.
It initially tackled the basics of Python language, and informed about various aspects like lists, loops, and several packages including pandas, numpy, and seaborn among others.
The course futher progressed to introducing datasets into picture, on which we were supposed to apply basic algorithms like linear regression and logistic regression.</description>
