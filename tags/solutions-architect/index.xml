      <description>The AWS Solutions Architect Virtual Experience Program was an insightful and detailed look into understanding the work of a Solutions Architect.
The Program gave a wonderful opportunity to put myself in the shoes of an Architect and perform tasks that simulated the real life work.
The main aim of the module was to design a simple, scalable, hosting architecture and compile it as a letter to the client.
The task gave me an understanding of the various services that AWS provides like CodePipeline, RDS, and Elastic Load Balancing among others.</description>
